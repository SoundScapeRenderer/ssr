GETTING (THE SSR) STARTED

You should have a proper version of Jack installed by now (32 or 64 bit - matching the architecture of the SSR build you are using). If not, get it from https://jackaudio.org/ or from Homebrew. You can also obtain QJackCtl from there. 

Open QJackCtl and hit "play". This will start the Jack server process in background, which is needed by the SSR.

Start SSR. It consists of a GUI and a terminal window. The latter provides information about interesting things (e.g. if you forgot to start Jack). If something is not working, have a look there.
