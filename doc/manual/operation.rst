Compiling and Running the SSR
=============================

The following sections describe how to build and/or install the SSR on your
computer. The SSR can be used on GNU/Linux  and Mac OS X.
There is no MS Windows version of the SSR (yet?). If you feel inclined to port
the SSR to Windows, let us know!

Choosing the Operating System
-----------------------------

Well, first you'll need a proper operating system.
We recommend Debian GNU/Linux (http://www.debian.org/) or something Debian-based
like Ubuntu (http://www.ubuntu.com/).
The SSR should work on most modern Linux-distributions, though.
You can also try Arch Linux (http://www.archlinux.org/), if you want.
If you are reluctant to install a new operating system on your computer, you can
also install any of the above-mentioned operating systems virtually, for example
using http://www.virtualbox.org/.

If you happen to have Mac OS X installed on your computer, that's OK, too.

.. _debian_package:

The Debian Package
------------------

Thanks to IOhannes m zmoelnig, the SSR is available as a Debian package!

http://packages.debian.org/soundscaperenderer

.. note::

  The Debian distribution comes in several flavors, such as stable_, testing_
  and sid_ (meaning "still in development").
  At the time of writing, the *soundscaperenderer* package is part of "testing",
  so if you have Debian "stable" installed, you will have to add the package
  sources for "testing" (you can try the `Debian Sources List Generator`_).
  If it still doesn't work, you should consider upgrading your whole system to
  "testing" or, if that's not feasible, you can still compile and install the
  SSR from its source (see below for instructions).
  
  .. _stable:  http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/
  .. _testing: http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/
  .. _sid:     http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/
  .. _Debian Sources List Generator: http://debgen.simplylinux.ch/

You can install the *soundscaperenderer* package using your favorite package
manager (*apt-get*, *aptitude*, *synaptic*, ...), all dependencies should be
installed automatically.

The package may or may not work on other Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.
Feel free to try it and report back to us.

Once the SSR is installed, move on to the section :ref:`running_ssr`.

Getting the Source
------------------

If you didn't receive this manual with the source code of the SSR, you
have to download it from the SSR website http://spatialaudio.net/ssr or from
the git repository. Refer to Section :ref:`Compiling and Installing from the
Git Repository <compiling_from_git>` in the latter case. Otherwise, continue
reading this section.

Once you downloaded the tarball (the file that ends in ``.tar.gz``), unpack it
and change to the newly created directory::

    tar xvzf ssr-x.y.z.tar.gz
    cd ssr-x.y.z/

Of course, ``x``, ``y`` and ``z`` should have been replaced by the actual
version number. If you are new to Unix-like operating systems, you should try
*shell completion*: just start typing the beginning of the command (e.g. ``tar
xvzf ssr``) and hit the Tab-key. Wow, the whole file name gets completed!

.. _configuring:

Configuring and Compiling
-------------------------

To build the SSR from source you have to configure first. Open a shell
and ``cd`` to the directory containing the source code of the package
and type::

    ./configure

This script will check your system for dependencies and prepare the
``Makefile`` required for compilation. Section
:ref:`Dependencies <dependencies>` lists
the dependencies that must be installed on your system. The
``configure`` script will signal if dependencies are missing. At
successful termination of the ``configure`` script a summary will show
up and you are ready to compile. If dependencies for certain modules of SSR
are missing that you are not going to use then you can simply disable the
according module by adding the appropriate argument to the call to the ``
configure`` script so that you do not need to bother with the dependencies.
Examples are ::

  ./configure --disable-ip-interface
  ./configure --disable-gui

See Section :ref:`Hints on Configuration <hints_conf>` for details.


If everything went smoothly, you can continue with the next step::

    make

This will take some time (maybe a few minutes). If you have a multi-core or
multi-processor computer you can speed up things by specifying the number of
processes you want to use with ``make -j8`` (or any other number that you
choose).

.. _dependencies:

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following list is a list of packages which you should install with the
package manager of your choice (``apt-get``, ``aptitude``, ``synaptic``, ...).
However, if you prefer, you can of course also download everything as source
code and compile each program yourself.

- **make**
- **g++** (at least version 4.7.3) or **clang**
- **libasio-dev**
- **qtbase5-dev** and **libqt5opengl5-dev** (To build the GUI)
- **libecasoundc2.2-dev** or **libecasoundc-dev**
- **ecasound**
- **libxml2-dev**
- **libfftw3-dev**
- **libsndfile1-dev**
- **libjack-dev** or **libjack-jackd2-dev**
- **jackd** or **jackd1** or **jackd2**
- **pkg-config**

Extra dependencies for installing from the Git repository:

- **libtool**
- **automake**

Note that there are additional dependencies for some of the tracking systems
that SSR supports. Refer to Section :ref:`head_tracking` for
further information.

To use a different compiler, you can specify it with ``CXX``::

    ./configure CXX=clang++

.. _hints_conf:

Hints on Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you encounter problems configuring the SSR these hints could help:

-  Ensure that you really installed all libraries (``lib``) with
   devel-package (``devel`` or ``dev``, where available) mentioned in
   Section :ref:`Dependencies <dependencies>`.

-  It may be necessary to run ``ldconfig`` after installing new
   libraries.

-  Ensure that ``/etc/ld.so.conf`` or ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` are set
   properly, and run ``ldconfig`` after changes.

-  If a header is not installed in the standard paths of your system you
   can pass its location to the configure script using
   ``./configure CPPFLAGS=-Iyourpath``.

Note that with ``./configure --help`` all configure-options are
displayed, e.g. in Section "Optional Features" you will find how to
disable compilation of the head trackers and many other things. Setting
the influential environment variables with ``./configure VARNAME=value``
can be useful for debugging dependencies.

Installing
----------

Until now, everything was happening in the source directory (something like ssr
-x.x.x/). To be really useful, the SSR should be installed on the system with
the command ::

    make install

On some systems you need root privileges for this step. However, it's easier
if you set up your system to be able to do it as a normal user. On Debian,
it's enough to add your username to the ``staff`` group. Just run this command
(as root or using ``sudo``): ``adduser myuser staff`` (replacing ``myuser`` by
your actual user name). On other systems you may try something like this (
again, as root or using ``sudo``): ``chown myuser:myuser /usr/local -R`` (
again, replacing ``myuser`` by your user name).

Uninstalling
------------

If the SSR didn't meet your expectations, we are very sorry, and of
course you can easily remove it from your system with ::

    make uninstall

.. _compiling_from_git:

Compiling and Installing from the Git Repository
------------------------------------------------

In short, in order to install on your machine, open a terminal, create a
folder that will host the source code, ``cd`` to that folder, and type ::

    git clone https://github.com/SoundScapeRenderer/ssr.git

to download the source code. Then execute ::

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install

inside the folder in which SSR resides. You'll probably have to have root
privileges for the installation. Of course, all dependencies of the
compilation process apply. See Section :ref:`Dependencies <dependencies>`.

.. _running_ssr:

Running the SSR
---------------

Before you start the SSR, start JACK, e.g. by typing
``jackd -d alsa -r 44100`` in a shell or using the graphical user
interface "qjackctl". Now, the easiest way to get a signal out of the
SSR is by passing a sound-file directly::

    ssr YOUR_AUDIO_FILE

By default, the SSR starts with the binaural renderer; please use
headphones for listening with this renderer. Type ``ssr --help`` to get
an overview of the command line options and various renderers:

.. code-block:: none

    USAGE: ssr [OPTIONS] <scene-file>

    -v, --verbose          Increase verbosity level (up to -vvv)
    -V, --version          Show version information and exit

Choose the appropriate arguments and make sure that your amplifiers are
not turned too loud…

To stop the SSR use either the options provided by the GUI (Section
:ref:`GUI <gui>`) or type ``Crtl+c`` in the shell in which you started the SSR.

Keyboard actions in non-GUI mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you start SSR without GUI (option ``--no-gui``), it starts
automatically replaying the scene that you have loaded. You can have some
interaction via the shell. Currently implemented actions are (all
followed by ``Return``):

-  ``c``: calibrate tracker (if available)

-  ``p``: start playback

-  ``q``: quit application

-  ``r``: "rewind"; go back to the beginning of the current scene

-  ``s``: stop (pause) playback

Note that in non-GUI mode, audio processing is always taking place. Live
inputs are processed even if you pause playback.

Recording the SSR output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can record the audio output of the SSR using the
``--record=FILE`` command line option. All output signals
(i.e. the loudspeaker signals) will be recorded to a multichannel wav-file
named ``FILE``. The order of channels corresponds to the order of loudspeakers
specifed in the reproduction setup (see Sections
:ref:`Reproduction Setups <reproduction_setups>` and
:ref:`ASDF <asdf>`). The recording can then be used to analyze the SSR output or
to replay it without the SSR using a software player like "ecaplay" (http://
eca.cx/ecasound/).

.. _ssr_configuration_file:

Configuration Files
-------------------

The general configuration of the SSR (whether GUI is enabled, which tracker
to use, and most other command line arguments) can be specified in a
configuration file (e.g.
``ssr.conf``). By specifying your settings in such a file, you avoid
having to give explicit command line options every time you start the
SSR. We have added the example
:download:`data/ssr.conf.example <../../data/ssr.conf.example>`,
which mentions
all possible parameters. Take a look inside, it is rather
self-explanatory. There are three possibilities to specify a
configuration file:

Configuration files are loaded in the following order, if certain options are
specified more than once, the last occurrence counts. This means that it is
not the last file that is loaded that counts but rather the last occurrence at
which a given setting is specified.

1. ``/Library/SoundScapeRenderer/ssr.conf``
2. ``/etc/ssr.conf``
3. ``$HOME/Library/SoundScapeRenderer/ssr.conf``
4. ``$HOME/.ssr/ssr.conf``
5. the path(s) specified with the ``--config``/``-c`` option(s) (e.g.,
    ``ssr -c my_config.file``)

We explicitly mention one parameter here that might be of immediate
interest for you: ``MASTER_VOLUME_CORRECTION``. This a correction in
dB (!) that is applied -- as you might guess -- to the master volume. The
motivation is to have means to adopt the general perceived loudness of
the reproduction of a given system. Factors like the distance of the
loudspeakers to the listener or the typical distance of virtual sound
sources influence the resulting loudness, which can be adjusted to the
desired level by means of the ``MASTER_VOLUME_CORRECTION``. Of course,
there's also a command line alternative (``--master-volume-correction``).

.. _head_tracking:

Head Tracking
-------------

We provide integration of the *InterSense InertiaCube3* tracking sensor,
the *Polhemus Fastrak* and the *Polhemus Patriot*. They are used to update the orientation of
the reference (in binaural reproduction this is the listener) in
real-time. Please read Sections :ref:`Preparing Intersense <prep_isense>` and
:ref:`Preparing Polhemus <prp_pol>` if you want to compile the SSR with the
support
for these trackers.

Note that on startup, the SSR tries to find the tracker. If it fails, it
continues without it. If you use a tracker, make sure that you have the
appropriate rights to read from the respective port.

You can calibrate the tracker while the SSR is running by pressing
``Return``. The instantaneous orientation will then be interpreted as
straight forward, i.e. upwards on the screen (:math:`\alpha = 90^\circ`\ ).

.. _prep_isense:

Preparing InterSense InertiaCube3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to compile the SSR with support for the *InterSense
InertiaCube3* tracking sensor, please download the *InterSense Software
Development Kit* (SDK) from the InterSense website (http://www.intersense.com;
Support |arrow| Downloads |arrow| Development and Troubleshooting Tools).
Unpack the archive and place the files

.. |arrow| unicode:: U+2192 .. RIGHTWARDS ARROW

-  ``isense.h`` and ``types.h`` to ``/usr/local/include``, and

-  ``libisense.so`` (the version appropriate for your processor type) to
   ``usr/local/lib``.

The SSR ``configuration`` script will automatically detect the presence
of the files described above and if they are found, enable the
compilation for the support of this tracker. To disable this tracker,
use ``./configure --disable-intersense`` and recompile.

If you encounter an error-message similar to
``libisense.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory``,
but the file is placed correctly, run ``ldconfig``.

Make sure that you have the required access rights to the tracker before
starting SSR. For you are using the USB connection type ::

  sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSBX

whereby ``X`` can be any digit or number. If you are not sure which port is
the tracker then unplug the tracker, type ::

  ls /dev/ttyUSB*

replug the tracker, execute above command again and see which port was added.
That one is the tracker. It's likely that it is the one whose name contains
the highest number.

.. _prp_pol:

Preparing Polhemus Fastrak/Patriot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For incorporation of the *Polhemus Fastrak/Patriot*
with serial connection, no additional libraries are required. Make sure that
you have the required access rights to the tracker before starting SSR by
typing something like :: 

  sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS0

or :: 

  sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS1

or so.

If you want to disable this tracker, use ``./configure --disable-polhemus``
and recompile.

Preparing VRPN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use *Virtual Reality Peripheral Network* (VRPN_) compatible
trackers create a config file ``vrpn.cfg`` with one of the following lines (or
similar)

.. _VRPN: http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn/index.html

::

  vrpn_Tracker_Fastrak MyFastrak /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
  vrpn_Tracker_Fastrak MyOtherFastrak COM1 115200
  vrpn_Tracker_Liberty MyPatriot /dev/ttyUSB1 115200

... and start ``vrpn_server``. You can choose the name of the Tracker
arbitrarily. Then, start the SSR with the given Tracker name, e.g.::

  ssr-binaural --tracker=vrpn --tracker-port=MyFastrak@localhost

If the tracker runs on a different computer, use its hostname (or IP address)
instead of localhost. You can of course select your head tracker settings by
means of :ref:`Configuration Files<ssr_configuration_file>`.

Using the SSR with different audio clients
------------------------------------------

This page contains some short description how to connect your own audio files
with the SSR using different audio players.

VLC Media Player
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to connect the SSR in binaural playback mode with the own audio library
using Jack and VLC Media Player:

After installing Jack and the SSR (with all needed components: see :ref:`
Configuring and Compiling <configuring>`) it is necessary to install the VLC
Media Player with its Jack plugin (for example UBUNTU):

1. ``sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-jack``

    (or use the packet manager of your choice instead of the command line and
    install: vlc and vlc-plugin-jack)

2. After installing open VLC Media Player and navigate to Tools->Preferences
Select "All" on the bottom left corner In the appearing menu on the left
navigate to "Audio"->"Output Module" and extend it by using "+"

3. In the submenu of "Output Module" select "JACK" and replace "system" by "
Binaural-Renderer" in the "Connect to clients matching"-box. Do not forget to
enable "Automatically connect to writable clients" above. (Otherwise you have
to connect the audio output of vlc with the SSR input after every played audio
file using jack.)

  (*Note*: If you want to use another Renderer, e.g. for WFS, you have to
  enter "WFS-Renderer" in the box)

  .. figure:: images/screenshot_vlc.png
    :align: center

4. Save your changes.

5. Start everything together using the command line::

    qjackctl -s & vlc & ssr --gui /"path_of_your_scene_file(s)"/stereo.asd &

    This will start jack, vlc and the ssr with the GUI and a provided stereo
    scene (TODO: LINK) (stereo.asd)

6. Open an audio file in vlc and press play

.. _mac_os_x:

Mac OS X
--------

Application Bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This assumes that you are using the precompiled SSR application bundle for Mac OS
X. If you want to build the SSR yourself, have a look at `Building from Source`_.

You can download the application bundle from http://spatialaudio.net/ssr. You will need 
JACK as prerequisite. Refer to `JACK on Mac OS X`_ for instructions how to obtain and
install it. 

The installation should be straightforward. Just double-click on the ``.dmg`` file and
drag the ``SoundScapeRenderer-x.x.x`` folder to your ``Applications`` folder. Done. When
double-clicking the SSR application bundle, it will indicate to you that you should
download and install JACK (that's what this JACK.webloc thingy wants). If JACK is
installed on your computer, then simply ignore this step and drag the SSR folder to your
``Applications`` folder.

The application bundle can be placed anywhere, but spaces in path names might
cause trouble, so it's better to avoid them. Another thing is that Mac OS X
sort of adds applications placed in the ``/Applications`` folder to the
environment, so lets assume you put the SSR there (This also works for
``$HOME/Applications``).

Building from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is an overview on how to set up the build environment for SSR on Mac OS X.

What to install first?
::::::::::::::::::::::

You can make your life much easier with a decent package manager, name Homebrew (http://brew.sh/) or MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/). Both greatly simplify the process of installing and managing dependencies.

.. _Homebrew:

Homebrew (recommended)
**********************

After installing homebrew, you can simply run the following line to update homebrew's
internal repository, upgrade itself and install all necessary dependencies::

  brew update && brew upgrade && brew install autoconf fftw libsndfile jack ecasound qt asio --c++11

To build the manual and documentation, you can also install help2man and doxygen::

  brew install help2man doxygen

MacPorts
********

Tested with version 1.9.2

Download here: http://www.macports.org/

Then open a terminal and do an initial ports tree update ::

  sudo port selfupdate

If that is not working it's most likely because the router won't let you use
rsync. So we switch to http::

  sudo nano /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf

Comment out the rsync entry ::

  #rsync://rsync.macports.org/release/ports/ [default]

And add a line ::

  http://www.macports.org/files/ports.tar.gz [default]

Now save the file and try the selfupdate again.

MacPorts ports
**************

These ports have to be installed (dependencies are installed automatically)

- gcc49 (or some other version of GCC, but at least gcc47)
- pkgconfig
- libsndfile
- libsamplerate
- fftw-3-single
- qt5-mac
- libxml2

If you want, you can also use clang instead of GCC to compile the SSR.

If you want to install the newest SSR development version directly from the Git repository, you'll need those as well:

- autoconf
- automake
- help2man

Ports are installed using ::

  sudo port install <portname>

Because ports are compiled locally, it may take a long time to install all
ports. Issuing one command to install all ports might be more convenient::

  sudo sh -c "port install gcc49 && port install pkgconfig && port install libsndfile && port install libsamplerate && port install fftw-3-single && port install qt5-mac && port install libxml2"

Lastly, you need to install the asio library if you want to compile with the network
interface. You can download it from: http://think-async.com

JACK on Mac OS X
****************

Tested with version 0.87 (64 bit) which includes:

- Jackdmp 1.9.6
- JackRouter 0.9.3
- JackPilot 1.7.0

Note that the site http://www.jackosx.com/ is outdated. The latest version of JACK is 
available from http://jackaudio.org/downloads/. 

Or, you can install JACK using Homebrew_.

OS X El Capitan is a little trickier as there is no official JACK version for it. When
scrolling down `this thread`_ you'll find a link to a beta version of JACK that works on 
El Capitan. Here's the direct link to this beta version of JACK:

.. _ecasound:

Ecasound
********

Tested with version 2.7.2

If you don't want to get Ecasound from Homebrew_, then download the source code from 
http://www.eca.cx/ecasound/. (If you choose to use Homebrew and you're experiencing
problems, then you might want to take a look at :ref:`ecasound_cannot_open_a_jack_port`).

It didn't work with 2.9.0 for us, older versions can be found there:
http://ecasound.seul.org/download/.

In Terminal go into the unpacked ecasound folder and do::

  ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LIBS=-L/opt/local/lib

If JACK cannot be found, you can also try this::

  ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include -I/usr/local/include" LIBS=-L/opt/local/lib

When the configure script is finished, check if libsndfile, libsamplerate and
JACK are enabled. It should look something like that::

  ...
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Following features were selected:
  ...
  Libsndfile:             yes
  ...
  JACK support:           yes
  Libsamplerate support   yes
  ...
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  ...

If not, check that JACK and all MacPort packages mentioned above are installed.
If everything looks OK, continue with::

  make
  make install

For the last step you need write access to ``/usr/local``.
If it doesn't work, use this instead::

  sudo make install

Ecasound -- git version
***********************

Note: if you successfully installed Ecasound 2.7.2, you *don't* need this!

If you want to use the newest Ecasound version from their git repository
(http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound.git) with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks),
you can try this::

  ./configure CXX="clang++ -stdlib=libc++" CPPFLAGS=-D_DARWIN_C_SOURCE

Note, however, that you will have to use the same -stdlib options when
configuring the SSR.

Standard build
**************

Get the SSR Source tarball and unpack it where ever you wish, then open a
Terminal window and ``cd`` into the newly created folder.

First of all, you have to issue this command in order for ``pkg-config`` to
find the installed JACK version::

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

You now have two options:

\1) If you want to build a clickable application bundle and wrap it into a
``.dmg image``, you can build the SSR in *Mac OS X* style::

  ./configure --enable-app-bundle
  make
  make dmg

You can also name the ``.dmg``::

  ./configure
  --enable-app-bundle="MyVeryOwnSoundScapeRenderer.dmg"
  make
  make dmg

The resulting ``.dmg`` is output to the SSR source folder. The application
bundle inside contains all non-system dynamic libraries needed by the SSR,
except the JACK libs. So it should run on every Mac OS X 10.6.x with JACK
installed.

\2) If you want to build and install in *Linux* style::

  ./configure
  make
  make install

For the last step you need write access in ``/usr/local``. If it doesn't work,
use this instead::

  sudo make install

The binaries do not get wrapped in an application bundle but they will be
installed in ``/usr/local/bin`` and some files will be installed in ``/usr/
local/share/ssr``. If you want to remove all these file again, just do::

  make uninstall

or (if you used ``sudo`` before)::

  sudo make uninstall

You can start the SSR and pass arguments to the SSR the same way you would do
it on Linux.

.. _mac_intersense_support:

Build with InterSense tracker support
*************************************

Tested with IntertiaCube3, software version 4.17

Get the SDK from http://www.intersense.com/. It should contain a dynamic
library called ``libisense.dylib`` and two header files called ``isense.h``
and ``types.h``, respectively.

Put ``libisense.dylib`` into ``/usr/local/lib`` and the header files into ``/
usr/local/include/intersense``.

Then build like described above, but add ``CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/
intersense`` to the configure parameters::

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
  ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/intersense

For some strange reason the full path of ``libisense.dylib`` is not written to
the header of the binary. So if you configure with ``--enable-app-bundle`` and
then do ``make dmg`` to build an application bundle, a tool called
``dylibbundler`` will ask you to enter its path (``/usr/local/lib``) several
times.

Using the GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Run the JackPilot and hit start.
2. Double-click the SoundScape Renderer icon |icon|, select the renderer type,
    and off you go!

.. |icon| image:: images/ssr_logo_mac_30px.png

When the SSR is started, a Terminal window displaying the standard SSR output
is automatically opened. If the SSR closes with an error, it remains open for
you to inspect the error messages.

The SSR and JACK must have the same sampling rate, otherwise error will be
generated.

More options can be specified by using the config file. The details of using
the config file is described on the Section
:ref:`ssr_configuration_file`.

Running via the Command Line (Terminal)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application bundle is more convenient, but brings limitations when using
the command line. The included start script changes the working directory to
the directory that includes the SSR application bundle, so only absolute paths
should be used on the command line.

What can be done using configuration files, should be done using configuration
files.

Both JACK and the SSR can be started on the command line by using::

    open -a JackPilot
    open -a SoundScapeRenderer

If the SSR is placed in ``/Applications`` (or ``$HOME/Applications``) and was
run several times already, OS X should find it. If not, you would have to
specify the full path, i.e. ::

    open /Applications/SoundScapeRenderer-0.4.0/SoundScapeRenderer.app

The SSR starts with a prompt for renderer selection, with the default renderer
set on the Binaural renderer. As mentioned above in Section
:ref:`ssr_configuration_file`,
more options at the start up can
be specified using the configuration file.

To start the SSR using a different renderer module and skip the prompt for the
selection do::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural

Of course, instead of ``--binaural``, you can also use any of the other
available renderers (e.g. ``--wfs`` for Wave Field Synthesis). To see all
available command line arguments (specifying a renderer skips the prompt for renderer
selection)::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural "--help"

.. note:: The arguments other than the renderer selection have to be enclosed in
        quotation marks (``""``)!
        
To load a scene do::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural "/absolute/path/to/scene.asd"

.. note:: Paths have to be absolute!

To load a scene that has spaces in its path name do::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural "/path/to/file\ with\ spaces.asd"

.. note:: Spaces have to be escaped using backslashes!

In addition to the config files in standard locations mentioned above, you can
also specify a config file on the command line::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural "--config=my_config_file.conf"

When you want to record the output of the SSR and play it back again, you
should always provide the .wav extension of the file name, along with the
absolute path of your desired destination location for the file. As an
example, if you want to run the SSR and record the output to a file name
output.wav, you would need the command given below::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural "--record=/tmp/output.wav"

But if you use a relative path instead of the absolute path, the file that
contains the output of the SSR will be saved inside the directory of the
SoundScape Renderer in the Applications folder.

If you want to start more than one instance of SSR, then add the ``-n`` option to the call
of ``open`` for all instances other than the first one::

    open -n -a SoundScapeRenderer --binaural

Using a Head-Tracker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running with InterSense tracker support
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Due to copyright reasons, the SSR does not come with a built-in InterSense
tracker support. So first you have to build the SSR with :ref:`InterSense
tracker support <mac_intersense_support>` yourself or ask someone to do it for
you.

If you are using a USB-to-Serial interface with your tracker, you need to
install drivers for that. This seems to work fine for the interface made by
InterSense: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm

To check if the system sees the tracker do::

    ls -l /dev/tty.usb*

On the MacBooks tested, the serial ports were called ``/dev/tty.usbserial-
00001004`` or ``/dev/tty.usbserial-00002006`` depending on which USB port was
used.

To make the SSR use the InterSense tracker with these ports, you have two
options:

Using the command line (only one port can be specified)::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural "--tracker=intersense
    --tracker-port=/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX"

... or using config files:

Add these lines to a config file (multiple ports can be specified)::

    TRACKER = intersense
    TRACKER_PORTS = /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX /dev/tty.usbserial-YYYYYYYY

It's recommended to use the config file approach - best use a global :ref:`
config file<ssr_configuration_file>`.

Running with Razor AHRS tracker support
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If you happen not to own a Polhemus or InterSense tracker to do your head-
tracking, an alternative would be to use our DIY low-cost `Razor AHRS tracker`_.

.. _`Razor AHRS tracker`:
  https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/sf-razor-9dof-ahrs

If you have Arduino installed on you machine, FTDI drivers will be there too.
Otherwise get the driver from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm .

To check if the system sees the tracker do::

    ls -l /dev/tty.usb*

This should give you something like ``/dev/tty.usbserial-A700eEhN``.

To make the SSR use this Razor AHRS tracker, you have two options:

Using the command line::

    open -a SoundScapeRenderer --args --binaural "--tracker=razor
    --tracker-port=/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX" 

... or using config files:

Add these lines to a config file::

    TRACKER = intersense
    TRACKER_PORTS = /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX

It's recommended to use the config file approach - best use a global
:ref:`config file<ssr_configuration_file>`.

Using the SSR with DAWs
-----------------------

As stated before, the SSR is currently not able to dynamically replay
audio files (refer to Section :ref:`ASDF <asdf>`). If your audio scenes are
complex, you might want to consider using the SSR together with a
digital audio work station (DAW). To do so, you simply have to create as
many sources in the SSR as you have audio tracks in your respective DAW
project and assign live inputs to the sources. Amongst the ASDF examples
we provide on SSR website http://spatialaudio.net/ssr/ you'll find an scene
description that does exactly this.

DAWs like Ardour (http://www.ardour.org) support JACK and their use is therefore
straightforward. DAWs which do not run on Linux or do not support JACK
can be connected via the input of the sound card.

In the future we will provide a VST plug-in which will allow you to
dynamically operate all virtual source's properties (like e.g. a
source's position or level etc.). You will then be able to have the full
SSR functionality controlled from your DAW.

Known Issues (Linux & Mac OS X)
-------------------------------

Also visit https://github.com/SoundScapeRenderer/ssr/wiki/Known-Issues for
updated known issues.

``make dmg`` on Mac OS X chokes on symbolic links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On some file system (e.g. network shares with ACLs) you might get an error
like this::

  ... copy helper ... copy error (canceling): /Volumes/SoundScape Renderer ...
  ... Operation not supported ... could not access /Volumes/...
  hdiutil: create failed - Operation not supported
  make[1]: *** [dmg] Error 1
  make: *** [dmg] Error 2

This has something to do with symbolic links and the way how ``hdiutil``
handles them. If you get this error, just try to compile the SSR from a
different location. You can do this by either moving all the source files
somewhere else, or by doing something like this::

  cd /tmp
  mkdir ssr-bundle
  cd ssr-bundle
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
  $PATH_TO_SSR_SOURCE/configure --enable-app-bundle
  make
  make dmg

In this example, ``$PATH_TO_SSR_SOURCE`` is the directory where you put the
SSR source files. Instead of ``/tmp`` you can of course use something else,
but with ``/tmp`` it should work on most systems out there.

If you don't like this work-around, you may also play around with ``fsaclctl``.
Only ``WAVE_FORMAT_PCM`` and ``WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT`` are supported.

Multi-channel WAV files would normally use the format
``WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE``, see
http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/documents/audioformats/wave/wave.html .

However, Ecasound doesn't know this format, that's why we have to use one of
the above mentioned formats, although for files with more than 2 channels this
is not compliant to the WAV standard.

To check the exact format of your WAV files, you can use sndfile-info (Debian
package sndfile-programs), and to convert your files, you can use, for
example, sox (Debian package sox) with the wavpcm option::

  sox old.wav new.wavpcm
  mv new.wavpcm new.wav
  
SSR crashes with a segmentation fault on Max OS X 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this happens whenever you are opening an audio file or loading a scene that involves opening an audio file, then this might be due to Ecasound. We've seen this with the app bundle. Try the following:

Download the Ecasound source code from http://nosignal.fi/ecasound/download.php. ``Cd`` into the folder and compile Ecasound with::

  ./configure
  make

Refer also to :ref:`ecasound` for instructions on how to compile Ecasound. The executable ``ecasound/ecasound`` will be created.

Finally, replace the Ecasound executable in the SSR bundle with something like this::

  sudo cp ecasound/ecasound /Applications/SoundScapeRenderer-0.4.2-74-gb99f8b2/SoundScapeRenderer.app/Contents/MacOS/
  
You might have to modify the name of the SSR folder in the above command as you're likely to use a different version.

A file that can't be loaded results in a connection to a live input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is an error in loading a specified audio file, the corresponding
source is still created and (unexpectedly) connected to the first soundcard
input channel.

We believe this is a bug in the JACK system related to the API function
jack_connect()_: If the ``destination_port`` argument is an empty string, the
function returns (correctly) with an error. However, if the ``source_port``
argument is an empty string, the port is connected to the first "system" port (
or the first port at all, or who knows ...). And this is the case if the SSR
cannot open a specified audio file.

.. _jack_connect():
  http://jackaudio.org/files/docs/html/group__PortFunctions.html

If you also think that's a bug, feel free to report it to the JACK developers.

Conflicting JACK and Ecasound versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a problem due to a special combination of ecasound and JACK versions
on 64 bit systems leading to an error (terminating the SSR) similar to this::

  (ecasoundc_sa) Error='read() error', cmd='cs-connect' last_error='' cmd_cnt=6
 last_cnt=5.

We experienced this error on 64 bit systems with ecasound version 2.4.6.1 and 2
.7.0 in combination with JACK version 0.118.0. A similar error occured on Mac
OS X with ecasound version 2.7.2 and JackOSX version 0.89 (with Jackdmp 1.9.8).

Please try to update to the newest ecasound and JACK versions.

Annoying Ecasound message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may have seen this message::

  ***********************************************************************
  * Message from libecasoundc:
  * 
  * 'ECASOUND' environment variable not set. Using the default value
  * value 'ECASOUND=ecasound'.
  ***********************************************************************

You can totally ignore this, but if it bothers you, you can disable it easily
by specifying the following line in ``/etc/bash.bashrc`` (system-wide setting)
or, if you prefer, you can put it into your ``$HOME/.bashrc``
(just for your user account)::

  export ECASOUND=ecasound
  
.. _ecasound_cannot_open_a_jack_port:

Ecasound cannot open a JACK port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, when Ecasound is installed via Homebrew_, it can have trouble finding JACK. As
a result SSR displays the sound source symbols in the GUI, but they don't play audio, and
an according error message is posted in the SSR terminal.

Type ``ecasound -c`` in a terminal to start Ecasound in interactive mode. 
Then type ``aio-register`` to list all available outputs that Ecasound has recognized. If
JACK is not listed, then download the Ecasound source code from
http://nosignal.fi/ecasound/download.php, and ::

  ./configure --enable-jack
  make 
  make install
  
The last line might have to be ::

  sudo make install 
  
Refer also to :ref:`ecasound` for instructions on how to compile Ecasound.

Using SSR on Mac OS X El Capitan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SSR works well on El Capitan. JACK is what can cause headache. See `JACK on Mac OS X`_ .
  
Long paths to audio files on Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can happen that SSR displays this error message when loading audio files directily::

  Error: AudioPlayer::Soundfile: ERROR:  Connecting chainsetup failed: "Enabling chainsetup: AUDIOIO-JACK: Unable to open JACK-client" (audioplayer.cpp:310)
  Warning: AudioPlayer: Initialization of soundfile '/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/audio/YOUR_AUDIO_FILE.wav' failed! (audioplayer.cpp:87)

Opening such a file would result in a JACK port name that is too long. You can resolve
this limitation by moving the audio file to a location that produces a shorter (full) path
name or by wrapping the audio file in an asd-file. 

Segmentation Fault when Opening a Scene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This problem occured on some old SuSE systems.

When you start the SSR with GUI, everything is alright at first. As soon as
you open a scene, a segmentation fault arises. This is a problem in the
interaction between Qt and OpenGL. As a workaround, comment the line ::

  renderText(0.18f * scale, 0.13f * scale, 0.0f, source->name.c_str(), f);

in the file ``src/gui/qopenglrenderer.cpp`` and recompile the code. The
consequence is that the names of the sound sources will not be displayed
anymore.

Choppy Sound on Cheap (On-Board) Sound Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes JACK doesn't play well with those on-board sound cards. One
possibility to improve this, is to increase the frames/period setting from the
default 2 to a more generous 3. This can be done in the Settings dialog of
qjackctl or with the command line option ``-n``::

  jackd -n 3

``dylibbundler`` doesn't grok Qt Frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``make dmg`` doesn't copy the Qt ``.dylib`` files into the application
bundle (to ``Contents/Libraries``), you might try the following commands (or
similar, depending on the exact Qt installation).

.. raw:: latex

    Go to the \href{http://ssr.rtfd.org/en/latest/operation.html#dylibbundler-doesn-t-grok-qt-frameworks}
    {online manual} to copy and paste them.

::

  install_name_tool -id /opt/local/lib/libQtCore.dylib /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/QtCore
  install_name_tool -id /opt/local/lib/libQtGui.dylib /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/QtGui
  install_name_tool -change /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore /opt/local/lib/libQtCore.dylib /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/QtGui
  install_name_tool -id /opt/local/lib/libQtOpenGL.dylib /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtOpenGL.framework/QtOpenGL
  install_name_tool -change /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/5/QtCore /opt/local/lib/libQtCore.dylib /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtOpenGL.framework/QtOpenGL
  install_name_tool -change /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/5/QtGui /opt/local/lib/libQtGui.dylib /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtOpenGL.framework/QtOpenGL

You need the appropriate rights to change the library files, so you probably
need to use ``sudo`` before the commands.

*WARNING*: You can totally ruin your Qt installation with this stuff!

To get some information about a library, you can try something like those::

  otool -L /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtOpenGL.framework/QtOpenGL
  otool -l /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtOpenGL.framework/QtOpenGL
  otool -D /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtOpenGL.framework/QtOpenGL

SSR for Mac OS X: qt_menu.nib not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was fixed in MacPorts, see https://trac.macports.org/ticket/37662. Thanks to Chris Pike!
Since version 0.5 (switching to qt5), qt_menu.nib is not needed any more.

Compilation Error on Ubuntu and Archlinux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue was resolved in version 0.3.4. Some newer distributions got more
picky about the necessary ``#include`` commands. If the SSR refuses to
compile, add this to the file ``src/gui/qopenglplotter.h`` (somewhere at the
beginning)::

    #include <GL/glu.h>

On Mac OS X you'll need this instead::

    #include <OpenGL/glu.h>

Polhemus tracker does not work with SSR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue was resolved in version 0.3.3, where we changed the tracker
selection. Use ``--tracker=fastrak``, ``--tracker=patriot`` and ``--tracker=intersense``,
respectively. The serial port can be specified with ``--tracker-port=/dev/
ttyUSB0`` (or similar).

This can happen when both the Intersense tracker as well as the Polhemus
tracker are compiled and the file ``isports.ini`` is present. The latter tells
the Intersense tracker which port to use instead of the standard serial port
``/dev/ttyS0``. If the ``isports.ini`` file lists the port to which the
Polhemus tracker is connected, it can happen that something that we have not
fully understood goes wrong and the Pohlemus data can not be read. In this
case you can either rename the file isports.ini or change its content.

It might be necessary to execute ``echo C > /dev/ttyS0`` several times in
order to make the Polhemus tracker operational again. You can check with ``cat
/dev/ttyS0`` if it delivers data.

Missing GUI Buttons and Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue was resolved in version 0.3.2, the default setting for ``--enable-
floating-control-panel`` is chosen depending on the installed Qt version.
As of version 0.5 (switching to qt5), the floating control panel is always enabled.

Different versions of Qt show different behaviour regarding OpenGL Overlays
and as a result, the GUI buttons are not shown in newer Qt versions.

To overcome this limitation, we provide two GUI variants:

- Traditional GUI, can be used up to Qt 4.6.x
- Floating control panel, should be used with Qt 4.7 and above

The floating control panel is the default setting on Mac OS X, for Linux it
can be activated with::

    ./configure --enable-floating-control-panel

OpenGL Linker Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue was resolved in version 0.3.2.

On some systems, after running make, you'll get an error mentioning "
glSelectBuffer".

For now, this is the solution (see also the issue below)::

    ./configure LIBS=-lGL

IP interface isn't selected although boost libraries are installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This issue was resolved with dropping boost::asio for asio in version 0.5.0.

For older builds, you might need to add the ``-lpthread`` flag::

  ./configure LIBS=-lpthread

Second instance of SSR crashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This happens when two or more instances of the SSR are started with the IP server enabled.
Start all (or at least all instances higher than 1) with the ``-I`` flag to disable the
IP interface.

Audio files with spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This issue was resolved in version 0.3.2.

Please do not use audio files with spaces for scenes. Neither the filename nor
the directory referenced in the scene (asd-file) should contain spaces.

Error ``ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8`` when building the manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This can happen on non-US Macs. Go to your home folder ``/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME``, open (or
create) the file ``.bash_profile`` and add the following to this file::

  export LC_ALL=en_US.UFT-8
  export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
  export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
  export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
  
You might have to re-open the terminal or log out and in again to see the effect.
