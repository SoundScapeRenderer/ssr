    .. admonition:: How To Navigate This Site

        Use the *next* and *previous* links at the top and the bottom of each page
        to flip through the pages.
        Alternatively, you can use the right and left arrow keys
        on your keyboard.
        Some additional keyboard shortcuts
        are provided via the `accesskey feature`__:
        :kbd:`n` next,
        :kbd:`p` previous,
        :kbd:`u` up (= to the parent page),
        :kbd:`i` index,
        :kbd:`s` search and
        :kbd:`m` menu (= open/close sidebar).

        __ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/
            Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey

        Click on the `hamburger button`__ in the topbar
        to open and close the sidebar.
        The width of the sidebar can be adjusted by dragging its border.
        Click on the title in the topbar to scroll to the top of the page,
        if already at the top, go "up" to the parent page
        (eventually ending up on this very page).

        __ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button

        On *touch-enabled* devices:
        Tap at the top of the page to show the topbar (if it was scrolled away);
        swipe from the left edge to show the sidebar,
        swipe towards the left to hide it.
