WebSocket-based Network Interface
=================================

.. warning::

    We did not evaluate any of the network interfaces in terms of security.
    So please be sure that you are in a safe network when using them.

The WebSocket network interface can be activated with::

    ssr-binaural --websocket-server

This of course works for all renderers, not only ``ssr-binaural``.

Once the SSR is running, you can use your browser to connect to
http://localhost:9422/test.
This will show a simple test client which you can use to check whether
everything is working.

If you want to try out the :doc:`browser-gui`, use the address
http://localhost:9422.

By default, the port number 9422 is used.
You can choose a different port with::

    ssr-binaural --websocket-server=4321

The relevant settings in the :ref:`ssr_configuration_file` are::

    WEBSOCKET_INTERFACE = on
    WEBSOCKET_PORT = 4321
